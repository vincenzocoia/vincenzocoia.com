title: Career Goals
---

Over the years, I've discovered that my ideal career is composed of four interrelated pillars, all with respect to data science: research, development, application, and teaching.

### Research

I'm passionate about discovering better ways to do data science. 

Currently, I have two focusses. One is more fundamental: I'm questioning how the statistical framework that tends to be in place in academia should be modified in light of applications. For example, linear regression requires essentially no assumptions, despite many resources claiming the contrary. Another focus of mine is bringing to light the idea of evaluating tail index reduction in addition to variance reduction in regression.   

### Application
