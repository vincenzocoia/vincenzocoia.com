Hi!

I'm a teaching fellow in the UBC Dept. of Statistics.

I teach data science. I do statistical research in my spare time.

Bear with me as a learn github pages and construct this website. I'll be putting things like lecture notes and blog posts, so that (1) my students can refer back to notes on a more steady source, (2) others might benefit from my notes, and (3) I can refer back to my own notes to remember what I was thinking at some point in time.
