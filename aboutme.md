Hi!

I'm a data scientist, a teaching fellow, and researcher at the Department of Statistics at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver. My primary focus is the development and delivery of the [Master of Data Science program](https://masterdatascience.science.ubc.ca/). My research focusses on extreme quantile regression and copula-based machine learning methods.
