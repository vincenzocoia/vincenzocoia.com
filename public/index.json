But have you ever suspected that you could be after the wrong type of output before you even begin?\nRegression trees, loess, linear regression\u0026hellip; you name it, they\u0026rsquo;re all in pursuit of the mean (well, almost all). But the true outcome is random. It has a distribution. Are you sure you want the mean of that distribution?\nYou might say \u0026ldquo;Yes! It ensures my prediction is as close as possible to the outcome!\u0026rdquo; If this is indeed what you want, the mean still might not be your best choice \u0026ndash; it only ensures the mean squared error is minimized.\nThere are a suite of other options that might be more appropriate than the mean. The good thing is, your favourite supervised learning method probably has a natural extension for estimating these alternatives. Let\u0026rsquo;s investigate the quantities you might care about.\nThe Median No, the median isn\u0026rsquo;t just an inferior version of the mean, to be used under the unfortunate presence of outliers.\nIf I randomly pick a data scientist, what do you think their salary would be? This distribution has a right-skew, so chances are, your data scientist earns less than the mean. Predict the median, and you\u0026rsquo;ll have a 50% chance that your data scientist does earn at least what you predict.\nIn short, use the median when you want your prediction to be exceeded with a coin toss.\nMinimize the mean absolute error to get this prediction.\nHigher (or lower) Quantiles Want to make it to an interview on time? You add some \u0026ldquo;buffer time\u0026rdquo; to the expected travel time, right? What you\u0026rsquo;re after is a high quantile of travel time \u0026ndash; something like the 0.99-quantile, so that there is only a small chance you\u0026rsquo;ll be late (1% in this case).\nUse a high (or low) quantile if you want a conservative (or liberal) prediction \u0026ndash; or both, if you want a prediction interval.\nMinimize the mean rho function to get this prediction.\nThe Mean The mean is useful when we care about totals. Want to know how much gas a vehicle uses? You\u0026rsquo;re after the mean, because the total quantity drawn out over time is what matters.\nMinimize the mean squared error to get this prediction.\nOther Options Do you really need to distill your prediction down to a single number? Consider looking at the entire distribution of the outcome as your prediction (typically conditional on predictors) \u0026ndash; after all, this conveys the entire uncertainty about the outcome. This is known as probabilistic forecasting.\nThere are other measures, too. Expected shortfall is useful for risk analysis, or even expectiles. Maybe you care about variance or skewness for some reason. Whatever you want to get at, just make sure you ask yourself what you actually care about. You have an entire distribution to distill!\n(Photo from Pexels)\n","date":1518912000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1518912000,"objectID":"33b65142d22950dbc10e553d4d63fa91","permalink":"/project/2018-02-18-mean/","publishdate":"2018-02-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/2018-02-18-mean/","section":"project","summary":"You all know the drill \u0026ndash; you\u0026rsquo;re asked to make predictions of a continuous variable, so you turn to your favourite supervised learning method to do the trick.

Suppose you have a map of a mountainous region. How might you indicate elevation on that map, so that you get to see the shape of the landscape?\nThe idea is to use contour lines, which are curves that indicate a constant height.\nImagine cutting the tops of the mountains off by removing all land above, say, 900 meters altitude. Then trace (on your map) the shapes formed by the new (flat) mountain tops. These curves are contour lines. Choose a differential such as 50 meters, and draw these curves for altitudes ‚Ä¶800m, 850m, 900m, 950m, 1000m, ‚Ä¶ ‚Äì the result is a contour plot (or topographic map, if it‚Äôs a map).\nIn general, contour plots are useful for functions of two variables (like a bivariate gaussian density).\nWe‚Äôll look at examples in the next section.\nNotes on contours:\n They never cross. The steepest slope at a point is parallel to the contour line. They aren‚Äôt entirely ambiguous. For example, you can‚Äôt tell whether or not the mountains are actually mountains, or whether they‚Äôre holes/valleys! Sometimes you can add colour to indicate depth; other times (like in topographic maps) you can indicate elevation directly as numbers beside contour lines. Other times, this is not required, because the context makes it obvious.   Contour plots in ggplot2 There are two ways you can make contour plots in ggplot2 ‚Äì but they‚Äôre both for quite different purposes.\nMethod 1: Approximate a bivariate density This method approximates a bivariate density from data.\nFirst, recall how this is done in the univariate case. A little kernel function (like a shrunken bell curve) is placed over each data point, and these are added together to get a density estimate:\nlibrary(ggplot2) ## Warning: package \u0026#39;ggplot2\u0026#39; was built under R version 3.5.2 set.seed(373) x \u0026lt;- rnorm(1000) ggplot(data.frame(x=x), aes(x)) + geom_density() We can do the same thing to get a bivariate density, except with little bivariate kernel functions (like shrunken bivariate Gaussian densities). But, we can‚Äôt just simply put ‚Äúdensity height‚Äù on the vertical axis ‚Äì we need that for the second dimension. Instead, we can use contour plots.\nThis is the contour plot that ggplot2‚Äôs geom_density2d() does: builds a bivariate kernel density estimate (based on data), then makes a contour plot out of it:\ny \u0026lt;- rnorm(1000) ggplot(data.frame(x=x, y=y), aes(x, y)) + geom_density2d() Based on context (this is a density), we know that this is a ‚Äúhill‚Äù and not a ‚Äúhole‚Äù. If you were to start at some point at the ‚Äúbottom‚Äù of the hill, the steepest way up would be perpendicular to the contours. The highest point on the hill is within the middle-most circle.\n Method 2: General Contour Plots You can also make contour plots that aren‚Äôt a kernel density estimate (necessarily), using geom_contour(). This is based off of any bivariate function.\nBasics Suppose we want to make a contour plot of the bivariate function \\[f(x,y) = x^2 + sin(y)\\] over the rectangle \\(-2\u0026lt;x\u0026lt;2\\) and \\(-5\u0026lt;y\u0026lt;5\\). First, make a grid over the rectangle (it must be a grid ‚Äì geom_contour() won‚Äôt work otherwise). Then, evaluate the function at each of the grid points. Put all this info into a single data frame with three columns (two for the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) coordinates, and one for the function evaluation). Then, indicate the function evaluation in geom_contour() as the aesthetic z, and the x and y aesthetics are as usual.\nf \u0026lt;- function(x) x[1]^2 + sin(x[2]) x \u0026lt;- seq(-2, 2, length.out=100) y \u0026lt;- seq(-5, 5, length.out=100) dat \u0026lt;- expand.grid(x=x, y=y) # Data frame of 100*100=10000 points. dat$z \u0026lt;- apply(dat, 1, f) ggplot(dat, aes(x, y)) + geom_contour(aes(z=z)) Notice that expand.grid is useful for making grids. It returns all pairs from the input vectors. But, this also means that it‚Äôs easy for the output to explode!\nNote that finer grids yield plots with higher accuracy. Here‚Äôs an example of a rough grid, whose contours are jagged:\nf \u0026lt;- function(x) x[1]^2 + sin(x[2]) x \u0026lt;- seq(-2, 2, length.out=10) y \u0026lt;- seq(-5, 5, length.out=10) dat \u0026lt;- expand.grid(x=x, y=y) # Data frame of 10*10=100 points. dat$z \u0026lt;- apply(dat, 1, f) ggplot(dat, aes(x, y)) + geom_contour(aes(z=z))  Additional Settings Here, we‚Äôll look at colouring the plots, and adding more/less contours.\nHere‚Äôs another example, with the volcano data (a matrix of altitudes for a volcano). If you‚Äôd like, first take a look at a 3D rendering of the volcano, by running the following code chunk in your R console after un-commenting the last two lines (code taken directly from rgl‚Äôs surface3d() documentation):\ndata(volcano) z \u0026lt;- 2 * volcano # Exaggerate the relief x \u0026lt;- 10 * (1:nrow(z)) # 10 meter spacing (S to N) y \u0026lt;- 10 * (1:ncol(z)) # 10 meter spacing (E to W) zlim \u0026lt;- range(y) zlen \u0026lt;- zlim[2] - zlim[1] + 1 colorlut \u0026lt;- terrain.colors(zlen) # height color lookup table col \u0026lt;- colorlut[ z - zlim[1] + 1 ] # assign colors to heights for each point # open3d() # surface3d(x, y, z, color = col, back = \u0026quot;lines\u0026quot;) Feel free to move the image around by clicking and dragging. Neat, eh?\nWe‚Äôll make a contour plot with this.\ndat \u0026lt;- expand.grid(x=x, y=y) dat$z \u0026lt;- as.vector(z)/2 # \u0026quot;De-exaggerate\u0026quot; the relief ggplot(dat, aes(x, y)) + geom_contour(aes(z=z)) + xlab(\u0026quot;\u0026quot;) + ylab(\u0026quot;\u0026quot;) + theme(axis.text=element_blank(), axis.ticks=element_blank()) But, you can‚Äôt tell that the inner circles actually represent a hole (a caldera), not a peak. Let‚Äôs add colour by indicating the ‚Äúvariable‚Äù ..height.. in the colour aesthetic of geom_cotour(), which will also indicate height as a legend:\ndat \u0026lt;- expand.grid(x=x, y=y) dat$z \u0026lt;- as.vector(z)/2 # \u0026quot;De-exaggerate\u0026quot; the relief ggplot(dat, aes(x, y)) + geom_contour(aes(z=z, colour=..level..)) + xlab(\u0026quot;\u0026quot;) + ylab(\u0026quot;\u0026quot;) + theme(axis.text=element_blank(), axis.ticks=element_blank()) + scale_color_continuous(\u0026quot;Altitude\u0026quot;) Now we can tell that the highest point is within the lightest blue area, to the left of the caldera.\nNow let‚Äôs add more contour lines, to get a better sense of the terrain. Do so by indicating the altitudes to make contours for via breaks. Let‚Äôs make 5 unit spacing:\ndat \u0026lt;- expand.grid(x=x, y=y) dat$z \u0026lt;- as.vector(z)/2 # \u0026quot;De-exaggerate\u0026quot; the relief ggplot(dat, aes(x, y)) + geom_contour(aes(z=z, colour=..level..), breaks=seq(100, 200, by=5)) + xlab(\u0026quot;\u0026quot;) + ylab(\u0026quot;\u0026quot;) + theme(axis.text=element_blank(), axis.ticks=element_blank()) + scale_color_continuous(\u0026quot;Altitude\u0026quot;) Although you can change the contours, it‚Äôs best practice to keep the (height) spacing between contour lines equal ‚Äì otherwise, the contour plot becomes harder to read. In the above plot, for example, we know that crossing \\(n\\) contour lines (that are either increasing or decreasing) results in \\(5n\\) units of elevation gain/loss, because the spacing between contours is always 5 units.\n   ","date":1487721600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1487721600,"objectID":"1cde67e5128905fad57b7e912e8832de","permalink":"/post/contour_plots/","publishdate":"2017-02-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/contour_plots/","section":"post","summary":"This tutorial introduces contour plots, and how to plot them in ggplot2.\nWhat is a contour plot?

We‚Äôll look at a basic example first, using intuition, and then describe mixture distributions mathematically. See the very end for a summary of the learning points.\nIntuition Let‚Äôs start by looking at a basic experiment:\nFlip a coin. If the outcome is heads, generate a N(0,1) random variable. If the outcome is tails, generate a N(4,1) random variable. We‚Äôll let \\(X\\) denote the final result.  \\(X\\) is a random variable with some distribution (spoiler: it‚Äôs a mixture distribution). Let‚Äôs perform the experiment 1000 times to get 1000 realizations of \\(X\\), and make a histogram to get a sense of the distribution \\(X\\) follows. To make sure the histogram represents an estimate of the density, we‚Äôll make sure the area of the bars add to 1 (with the ..density.. option).\nsuppressMessages(library(ggplot2)) ## Warning: package \u0026#39;ggplot2\u0026#39; was built under R version 3.5.2 set.seed(44) X \u0026lt;- numeric(0) coin \u0026lt;- integer(0) for (i in 1:1000) { coin[i] \u0026lt;- rbinom(1, size=1, prob=0.5) # flip a coin. 0=heads, 1=tails. if (coin[i] == 0) { # heads X[i] \u0026lt;- rnorm(1, mean=0, sd=1) } else { # tails X[i] \u0026lt;- rnorm(1, mean=4, sd=1) } } (p \u0026lt;- qplot(X, ..density.., geom=\u0026quot;histogram\u0026quot;, bins=30)) Let‚Äôs try to reason our way to figuring out the overall density. Keep in mind that this density (like all densities) is one curve. We‚Äôll say we‚Äôve succeeded at finding the density if our density is close to the histogram.\nIt looks like the histogram is made up of two normal distributions ‚Äúsuperimposed‚Äù. These ought to be related to the N(0,1) and N(4,1) distributions, so to start, let‚Äôs plot these two Gaussian densities overtop of the histogram.\nggplot(data.frame(X=X), aes(X)) + geom_histogram(aes(y=..density..), bins=30) + stat_function(fun=function(x) dnorm(x, mean=0, sd=1), mapping=aes(colour=\u0026quot;Heads\u0026quot;)) + stat_function(fun=function(x) dnorm(x, mean=4, sd=1), mapping=aes(colour=\u0026quot;Tails\u0026quot;)) + scale_color_discrete(\u0026quot;Coin Flip\u0026quot;) Well, the two Gaussian distributions are in the correct location, and it even looks like they have the correct spread, but they‚Äôre too tall.\nSomething to note at this point: the two curves plotted above are separate (component) distributions. We‚Äôre trying to figure out the distribution of \\(X\\) ‚Äì which, again, is a single curve, and is estimated by the histogram. At this point, we only suspect that the distribution of \\(X\\) is some combination of these two Gaussian distributions.\nSo, why are the Gaussian curves too tall? Because each one represents the distribution if we only ever flip either heads or tails (for example, the red distribution happens when we only ever flip heads). But since we flip heads half of the time, and tails half of the time, these probabilities (more accurately, densities) ought to be reduced by half. Let‚Äôs add these ‚Äúsemi‚Äù component distributions to the plot:\n(p \u0026lt;- ggplot(data.frame(X=X), aes(X)) + geom_histogram(aes(y=..density..), bins=30) + stat_function(fun=function(x) dnorm(x, mean=0, sd=1)*0.5, mapping=aes(colour=\u0026quot;Heads\u0026quot;, linetype=\u0026quot;Semi\u0026quot;)) + stat_function(fun=function(x) dnorm(x, mean=4, sd=1)*0.5, mapping=aes(colour=\u0026quot;Tails\u0026quot;, linetype=\u0026quot;Semi\u0026quot;)) + stat_function(fun=function(x) dnorm(x, mean=0, sd=1), mapping=aes(colour=\u0026quot;Heads\u0026quot;, linetype=\u0026quot;Full\u0026quot;)) + stat_function(fun=function(x) dnorm(x, mean=4, sd=1), mapping=aes(colour=\u0026quot;Tails\u0026quot;, linetype=\u0026quot;Full\u0026quot;)) + scale_color_discrete(\u0026quot;Coin Flip\u0026quot;) + scale_linetype_discrete(\u0026quot;Distribution\u0026quot;)) Looks like they line up quite nicely!\nBut these two curves are still separate ‚Äì we need one overall curve if we are to find the distribution of \\(X\\). So we need to combine them somehow. It might look at first that we can just take the upper-most of the ‚Äòsemi‚Äô curves (i.e., the maximum of the two), but looking in between the two curves reveals that the histogram is actually larger than either curve here. It turns out that the two ‚Äòsemi‚Äô curves are added to get the final curve:\np + stat_function(fun=function(x) dnorm(x, mean=0, sd=1)*0.5 + dnorm(x, mean=4, sd=1)*0.5, mapping=aes(linetype=\u0026quot;Full\u0026quot;)) The intuition behind adding the densities is that an outcome for \\(X\\) comes from both components, so both contribute some density.\nEven though the random variable \\(X\\) is made up of two components, at the end of the day, it‚Äôs still overall just a random variable with some density. And like all densities, the density of \\(X\\) is just one curve. But, this density happens to be made up of the components, as we‚Äôll see next.\n General Scenario The two normal distributions from above are called component distributions. In general, we can have any number of these (not just two) to make a mixture distribution. And, instead of selecting the component distribution with coin tosses, they‚Äôre chosen according to some generic probabilities called the mixture probabilities.\nIn general, here‚Äôs how we make a mixture distribution with \\(K\\) component Gaussian distributions with densities \\(\\phi_1(x), \\ldots, \\phi_K(x)\\):\nChoose one of the \\(K\\) components, randomly, with mixture probabilities \\(\\pi_1, \\ldots, \\pi_K\\) (which, by necessity, add to 1). Generate a random variable from the selected component distribution. Call the result \\(X\\).  Note: we can use more than just Gaussian component distributions! But this tutorial won‚Äôt demonstrate that.\nThat‚Äôs how we generate a random variable with a mixture distribution, but what‚Äôs its density? We can derive that by the law of total probability. Let \\(C\\) be the selected component number; then the component distributions are actually the distribution of \\(X\\) conditional on the component number. We get: \\[ f_X\\left(x\\right) = \\sum_{k=1}^{K} f_{X|C}\\left(x \\mid c\\right) P\\left(C=c\\right) = \\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\phi_k\\left(x\\right) \\pi_k. \\]\nNotes:  The intuition described in the previous section matches up with this result. For \\(K=2\\) components determined by a coin toss \\((\\pi_1=\\pi_2=0.5),\\) we have \\[ f_X\\left(x\\right) = \\phi\\left(x\\right)0.5 + \\phi\\left(x-4\\right)0.5, \\] which is the black curve in the previous plot. This tutorial works with univariate data. But mixture distributions can be multivariate, too. A \\(d\\)-variate mixture distribution can be made by replacing the component distributions with \\(d\\)-variate distributions. Just be sure to distinguish between the dimension of the data \\(d\\) and the number of components \\(K\\). We could just describe a mixture distribution by its density, just like we can describe a normal distribution by its density. But, describing mixture distributions by its component distributions together with the mixture probabilities, we obtain an excellent interpretation of the mixture distribution. This interpretation is (it‚Äôs also called a data generating process): (1) randomly choose a component, and (2) generate from that component. This interpretation is useful for cluster analysis, because the data clusters can be thought of as being generated by the component distributions, and the proportion of data in each cluster is determined by the mixture probabilities.    Learning Points  A mixture distribution can be described by its mixing probabilities \\(\\pi_1, \\ldots, \\pi_K\\) and component distributions \\(\\phi_1(x), \\ldots, \\phi_K(x)\\). A mixture distribution can also be described by a single density (like all continuous random variables).  This density is a single curve if data are univariate; a single ‚Äúsurface‚Äù if the data are bivariate; and higher dimensional surfaces if the data are higher dimensional.  To get the density from the mixing probabilities and component distributions, we can use the formula indicated in the above section (based on the law of total probability).

It‚Äôs not easy to say how the predictors influence the response from the fitted model.  They typically require a data-rich situation so that the estimation variance is acceptable, without compromising the estimation bias.  We‚Äôll look at classification and regression trees as another method (sometimes called CART). CARTs are not necessarily better, and in fact, tend to be poor competitors to other methods ‚Äì but ensemble extensions of these tend to perform well (a topic for next Monday).\nOur setting this time is the usual: we have a response \\(Y\\) (either categorical or numeric), and hope to predict this response using \\(p\\) predictors \\(X_1,\\ldots,X_p\\).\n When the response is categorical, we aim to estimate the mode and take that as our prediction. When the response is numeric, we aim to estimate the mean, and take that as our prediction.   Stumps: A preliminary concept What are they? Let‚Äôs say I get an upset stomach once in a while, and I suspect certain foods might be responsible. My response and predictors are:\n \\(Y\\): sick or not sick (categorical) \\(X_1\\): amount of eggs consumed in a day. \\(X_2\\): amount of milk consumed in a day, in liters.  You make a food diary, and record the following:\n  Eggs Milk Sick?    0 0.7 Yes  1 0.6 Yes  0 0 No  1 0.7 Yes  1 0 Yes  0 0.4 No    (Example from Mark Schmidt‚Äôs CPSC 340)\nA decision/classification stump is a decision on \\(Y\\) based on the value of one of the predictors. You can make one by doing the following steps:\nChoose a predictor (in this case, Milk or Eggs?) Choose a cutpoint on that predictor:  Subset the data having that predictor less than that cutpoint, and take the mode as your decision/classification. Subset the data having that predictor greater than that cutpoint, and take the mode as your decision/classification.   This will get you a decision/classification stump, like so:\n (Image attribution: Hyeju Jang, DSCI 571)\nThe same idea applies in the regression case, except we take the average of the subsetted data, and choose the best one according to the mean squared error.\nSome things to note:\n A decision on a numeric variable is always made based on a threshold (either less than or greater than). Although it makes sense to talk about a stump based on a more complicated decision, allowing for more complicated decisions would increase the search space, and would make fitting these models impractical. Plus, sometimes a more complicated decision can be broken down into several single-threshold decisions. It follows that decisions are always binary. Again, although it makes sense to talk about a stump that has more than two options, we can usually write these as a tree.   Choosing the best stumps Question: What is the error of the above decision stump? If we decide to make a prediction without a decision stump (or any predictors at all), what would the best prediction be, and what‚Äôs the error?\nWe have many stumps we can choose from ‚Äì which one is best?\nClassification:\n The one that gives the least error.  Tends to have a harder time disambiguating several options.  The Gini and Entropy criteria are two of the more commonly used measures.  These are measures of purity.   Regression:\n The one that gives the least mean squared error.    Partitioning of predictor space How does a stump partition the predictor space?\n Trees Notice that a tree is just a bunch of stumps!\nThis means:\n1. For numeric predictors, decisions can only involve one threshold. 2. Decisions are always binary. Optimal tree ‚Äì computationally infeasible Ideally, we‚Äôd examine the error from every possible regression tree, and choose the best one. But there are far too many trees possible! We turn to recursive binary splitting as the next best thing.\n Recursive Binary Splitting The idea to making a tree is to take a greedy approach: keep adding decision stumps, each time choosing the best stump.\nThis is called ‚Äúgreedy‚Äù because this method may not end up with the best tree ‚Äì it‚Äôs not computationally feasible to look many steps ahead to see whether a different path is more feasible.\nAdding ‚ÄúEggs \u0026lt; 1‚Äù to the above stump will be the next best iteration ‚Äì in this case, resulting in 100% prediction accuracy (on the training data). Notice that every time we add a stump, the error on the training set decreases.\nWe keep iterating until we reach some stopping criterion, often based on things such as:\n Tree depth Number of observations in a leaf becomes too small Error is not reduced significantly  Questions:\n How does ‚Äútree size‚Äù affect the bias-variance tradeoff? How can you choose these parameters?   Pruning Sometimes, a stopping criterion may cause the tree to stop growing prematurely. For example, perhaps we need an insignificant stump to form before getting a more significant one.\nTo avoid this, we take the approach of growing an overly large (overfit) tree, and then pruning it. We won‚Äôt get into details of how the tree is pruned back, but one technique is called cost complexity pruning. The general idea is to control a tuning parameter \\(\\alpha\\) to control how much pruning is done ‚Äì it can be chosen by cross-validation, or the validation set approach.\n  Exercise  Coding a decision tree with tree::tree() in R, using the titanic data. predict() and plot(), and ‚ÄúS3 generics‚Äù in R.

Because a classification or regression tree alone tends to be a poor competitor against other machine learning methods. In particular, they tend to be sensitive to the data: if fit to a separate training set, a completely different tree is prone to being fit. This is an embodiment of high variance.\nConsider the hypothetical situation: collect \\(B\\) data sets (of equal size), and fit a tree to all \\(B\\) of them. These \\(B\\) models are called an ensemble. Then if we want to predict on a new case (i.e., we‚Äôve observed the predictors but not the response), take the average predictions of the \\(B\\) trees in the case of regression, or the popular vote of the \\(B\\) trees in the case of classification. This will reduce variance.\nBut collecting \\(B\\) data sets is not practical, and splitting our single data set into \\(B\\) parts would not be a substitute, because we‚Äôd only be skyrocketing the variance of each tree before then reducing it in the ensemble.\n Bagging (= Bootstrap Aggregating) We can emulate the above hypothetical situation with a technique called the bootstrap. If your data set has \\(n\\) observations, then we can draw (for all intents and purposes) any number \\(B\\) of data sets we like. To generate one data set, just randomly sample \\(n\\) observations with replacement, and ta-da!\nThe \\(B\\) data sets are related in some sense, so are not as good as having \\(B\\) independent data sets. But it still gives us something useful ‚Äì in fact, tremendously useful. Go ahead and fit a tree on each data set, and combine the results ‚Äì that‚Äôs bagging in a nutshell.\nNote that we deliberately tend to overfit each tree in the ensemble, to get trees with low bias and high variance ‚Äì the variance of which will be reduced in the ensemble.\nThis concept of bootstrap is very widespread ‚Äì it‚Äôs not just used for trees, and not even just for machine learning. But for BAIT 509, trees are the only context you‚Äôll see bootstrap in.\nSize of \\(B\\) Note that we can‚Äôt overfit by increasing \\(B\\), because this just results in new data sets being generated ‚Äì not fitting more and more models to a single data set. The error (MSE or error rate) will drop as \\(B\\) increases, until it reaches a stable point where it no longer drops. Once this point is reached, increasing \\(B\\) does not do us much good. This is a common approach for choosing \\(B\\) ‚Äì no need for cross validation.\n Out of Bag (OOB) error With bagging comes a unique opportunity to calculate the out-of-sample/test error without having to partition the data into training and test sets (either through the validation set method, or cross validation). Here‚Äôs how.\nRemember how we obtain a single bootstrap data set: sample with replacement \\(n\\) times. This means that, for each bootstrap sample, there will be some observations that were left out. These are called out-of-bag (OOB) observations, and naturally form a test set!\nNow, obtain an estimate of generalization error (such as MSE or error rate) like so: for each observation in your full data set, consider the trees for which this observation is OOB, and use those to form an ensemble prediction. Compare this against the true value to get the error for this observation. Repeat for all observations.\n Predictor Importance We can use ensembles to determine the importance of certain predictors over others. Recall that the addition of a stump to a tree reduces the training error. We can set up a ‚Äúpoints system‚Äù, where a reduction in MSE is ‚Äúawarded‚Äù to the predictor responsible for the stump. Do this for all nodes in a tree to come up with a final score for each predictor ‚Äì the ones with the largest scores are most important.\n  Random Forests One problem with Bagging is that the trees in the ensemble tend to be correlated ‚Äì that is, they share similarities.\nRandom forests attempt to fix this problem by modifying how a single tree in the ensemble is grown. Recall that, when making a new stump to grow a tree, we choose one predictor out of the total \\(p\\) predictors. The idea behind random forests is to restrict this choice to some random subset of \\(m\\) predictors out of the \\(p\\). A new batch of \\(m\\) predictors is selected each time a stump is to be made.\nThe result is an ensemble of trees that look ‚Äúmore random‚Äù ‚Äì they are said to be decorrelated. This prevents any one predictor from ‚Äúdominating‚Äù the ensemble. And because the trees are less related, combining their predictions results in an overall better result.\n Discussion Questions  Bagging is a special case of random forests under which case? What are the hyperparameters we can control for random forests? Suppose you have the following paired data of (x,y): (1,2), (1,5), (2,0). Which of the following are valid bootstrapped data sets? Why/why not? (1,0), (1,2), (1,5) (1,2), (2,0) (1,2), (1,2), (1,5)  For each of the above valid bootstapped data sets, which observations are out-of-bag (OOB)? You make a random forest consisting of four trees. You obtain a new observation of predictors, and would like to predict the response. What would your prediction be in the following cases? Regression: your trees make the following four predictions: 1,1,3,3. Classification: your trees make the following four predictions: ‚ÄúA‚Äù, ‚ÄúA‚Äù, ‚ÄúB‚Äù, ‚ÄúC‚Äù.    Boosting Boosting is another method, different from random forests and bagging, but still involves combining predictions of an ensemble.\nThe details are beyond the scope of this course, so we will explain the main ideas. If you truly want a more comprehensive treatment, I suggest reading this Kaggle blog post.\nBasic boosting (Also see the ‚ÄúMotivation‚Äù part of the above Kaggle blog ‚Äì this part is not overly technical).\nLet‚Äôs look at a simple two-tree boosting ensemble for regression.\nFit a tree to your data Compute the residuals (actual minus prediction). Fit a second tree to the residuals.  To make a prediction on a new observation, do the following:\nFeed the predictors into the first tree to get a ‚Äúpreliminary‚Äù prediction. Feed the predictors into the second tree to get an adjustment. Obtain a final prediction by adding the adjustment to the preliminary prediction.  This second tree captures patterns in the data that the first tree missed, which is why boosting is so useful.\nBoosting, then, is a continuation of this, fitting trees in sequence.\n A conglomerate of ‚Äúweak learners‚Äù Boosting gradually improves predictions by learning on residuals. Because of this, there is no need to build a ‚Äústrong‚Äù model for each iteration ‚Äì i.e., one that does well at prediction.\nInstead, we deliberately build weak models to slowly get at the structure underyling the data. We therefore build low-depth trees for each member of the ensemble.\n Boosting for Classification The adjustments made here are less interpretable, but do follow a similar logic. Instead of learning on residuals, a consecutive tree leans on classes re-weighted so that observations that are incorrectly classified get a higher weight. This is called adaboost.\n Learning Rate It turns out that we obtain a more powerful prediction if we slow down the ‚Äúrate of learning‚Äù. We introduce a ‚Äúrate of learning‚Äù hyperparameter \\(\\lambda\\) between 0 and 1. Predictions from trees are multiplied by this amount before adjusting the prediction from the previous tree.\n  Ensembles in R randomForest We use the randomForest package and the randomForest function in R to implement random forests (and thus also bagging for classification and regression trees). The syntax follows R‚Äôs regression paradigm with randomForest(response~predictors, data). Let‚Äôs see an example with the mtcars data (a default data frame in R), predicting mpg (a regression problem):\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(randomForest)) set.seed(40) my_fit \u0026lt;- randomForest(mpg ~ ., data=mtcars) Note that the . stands for ‚Äúall other variables in the data frame‚Äù.\nThe plot function is useful for giving a quick-and-dirty plot of error vs. \\(B\\):\nplot(my_fit) There‚Äôs stability after around \\(B=200\\) trees.\nWarning! The predict function works differently than usual. Usually, the following two outputs would be the same:\nyhat1 \u0026lt;- predict(my_fit) yhat2 \u0026lt;- predict(my_fit, newdata=mtcars) But they‚Äôre not. Take a look:\nplot(yhat1, yhat2) What‚Äôs going on here? It turns out predict(my_fit) without specifying newdata gives the out of bag predictions, whereas the entire ensemble is used to make predictions when the newdata argument is specified. So the OOB error and training errors, respectively, are:\nmean((yhat1 - mtcars$mpg)^2) ## [1] 5.655269 mean((yhat2 - mtcars$mpg)^2) ## [1] 1.49721 Here are two key parameters you can change in the randomForest function:\n mtry: The number of predictors to sample at every stump iteration.  Set equal to the total number of predictors to perform bagging.  ntree: The number of trees to fit.   Boosting Boosting is not on your Assignment 2. For your reference, I‚Äôll indicate some useful implementations here.\n For regression, you can use the gbm function from the gbm R package to do boosting. But you can‚Äôt do classification beyond 2 classes. For classification, I recommend the AdaBoostClassifier from the sklearn.ensemble library.  This library also contains RandomForestClassifier for random forest classification. For plain decision trees (again for classification), the sklearn.tree library has a DecisionTreeClassifier method.

The response can take on one of two categories: ‚ÄúA‚Äù or ‚ÄúB‚Äù. Also consider the three classifiers, where above a line we predict ‚ÄúB‚Äù, and below, we predict ‚ÄúA‚Äù:\nEach line perfectly classifies the training data ‚Äì which one would you prefer, and why?\n The Method The Maximal Margin Classifier only applies when the two groups can be perfectly separated on the training set by:\n a dividing line (if we have 2 predictors), a dividing plane (if we have 3 predictors), or in general, we need a dividing hyperplane.  We choose the line/hyperplane so that the observations closest to the line/hyperplane are as far away as possible. This minimizes the chance that a new observation will be misclassified.\nWe can say this another way. Notice that, for any given line, we can define the ‚Äúwidest slab‚Äù before touching an observation. Here are the widest slabs for the above cases:\nThe Maximal Marginal Classifier chooses the line whose slab width is maximal. Half the ‚Äúslab width‚Äù is called the margin, so this classifier maximizes the margin. There are algorithms to do this maximization.\nWith this in mind, we can order the above three lines from best to worst: Line 2 is the worst, and Line 3 is the best.\nNotice that there are only three observations that define the slab for Line 3 ‚Äì these are called support vectors.\nBut: a perfect linear classification almost never happens with real data, but this is an important setup before moving on to support vector machines.\n Making Predictions, and Confidence We can classify new points as follows:\nIf \\((x1,x2)\\) lies above the line, predict ‚ÄúB‚Äù. If \\((x1,x2)\\) lies below the line, predict ‚ÄúA‚Äù.  But, we need a way to automate this, since orientation is not always natural with a hyperplane (for example, we have to switch to ‚Äúleft and right‚Äù if the dividing line is vertical).\nThe idea here is to write the equation of the line/hyperplane as \\[ \\beta_0 x_1 + \\beta_1 x_2 + \\beta_3 = 0. \\] We can then classify based on the sign of the left-hand-side of the equation. Note that this can be written in the usual y=mx+b format as \\[ x_2 = \\left(-\\frac{\\beta_0}{\\beta_1}\\right) x_1 + \\left(- \\frac{\\beta_3}{\\beta_1}\\right), \\] but this is only useful for plotting.\nFor the above classifier, the line is \\[ 0.59 x_1 - 0.66 x_2 + 0.46 = 0, \\] and we classify ‚ÄúB‚Äù whenever \\[ 0.59 x_1 - 0.66 x_2 + 0.46 \u0026lt; 0, \\] and ‚ÄúA‚Äù whenever \\[ 0.59 x_1 - 0.66 x_2 + 0.46 \u0026gt; 0. \\] You can figure out which is which by just trying a point that you know the classification of.\nThis equation also gives us a measure of confidence in our classification ‚Äì the further the magnitude of the left-hand-side is from 0, the further away from the separating hyperplane it is.\n  Support Vector Classifiers Support Vector Classifiers (or SVC) are more realistic in the sense that they don‚Äôt require perfect separability of the data.\nConsider now the following data:\nA SVC fits a line (or in general, a hyperplane) that ‚Äúbest‚Äù separates the data in some way. The idea, as before, is to choose the line that results in the biggest margin. The only problem is, there‚Äôs no such thing as a maximal margin for a given line anymore. Let‚Äôs work on defining that.\nHere‚Äôs an example of a line and a margin (not necessarily a ‚Äúmaximal‚Äù margin ‚Äì just some random margin that I chose). The dividing line is the middle one, so above this line is a ‚ÄúB‚Äù prediction. We‚Äôll call the upper and lower lines the ‚Äúmargin boundaries‚Äù.\nThe idea is to calculate a total penalty associated with each observation with this line-margin combination, like so:\nObservations that are both correctly classified and outside of the ‚Äúslab‚Äù do not receive any penalty. Observations that are correctly classified, but within the margin, receive a penalty equal to the proportion of the way through the margin they are.  This means that observations lying on the classification boundary receive a penalty of 1, because they are entirely one margin width away from its margin boundary.  Step (2) can be generalized to observations that are misclassified ‚Äì they receive a penalty equal to the number of margin widths they are away from their margin boundary.  This means that an ‚ÄúA‚Äù that‚Äôs on B‚Äôs margin boundary will receive a penalty of 2.   The numbered observations in the above plot receive a penalty:\n Penalty between 0 and 1: observations 2,3,5 Penalty between 1 and 2: observation 6 Penalty greater than 2: 1 and 4.  Add up the penalties to obtain a total penalty.\nIf we choose a maximum allowable total penalty, say \\(C\\), then for any line, there‚Äôs a set of margin widths that result in a penalty less than \\(C\\). The maximal margin for that line is the biggest margin.\nAgain, the algorithm chooses the line that has the biggest maximal margin, for a given total penalty \\(C\\).\nNote that, for the above plot, observations 1-6 are called support vectors, because they are the only ones to contribute to a penalty.\n In-class exercises Consider the following data, decision boundary, and margin boundaries.\nConstruct the decision rule according to this classification boundary. How would you classify a new observation that has \\(x_1=6\\) and \\(x_2=10\\)?   If x1\u0026lt;7.5, then ‚ÄúA‚Äù. Else ‚ÄúB‚Äù. For the above example, since x1=6\u0026lt;7.5, we would classify ‚ÄúA‚Äù.\n What size is the margin here?   The margin width is 2 units.\n Which observations receive a penalty? Which observations are the support vectors?   The observations that receive a penalty are 6,7,8,9,10. These are also the support vectors, by definition.\n What is the total penalty here?   The penalty, added in order of observations 6-10, is 0.25+0.25+1.25+1.75+2.25 = 5.75.\n Can I choose a bigger margin if my total allowable penalty is 6?   Yes ‚Äì increasing the margin will eventually lead to an increase in penalty, which is allowable.\n Are the data separable? If so, what are the support vectors?   The data are separable ‚Äì as such, we can apply a maximal margin classifier to it. The support vectors would be 4,8,9.\n  Support Vector Machines Quite often, a linear boundary is not useful for classification. Take the below extreme example:\nRecall in linear regression, we can fit other shapes besides lines by transforming the predictors, such as adding powers of the predictor to get polynomials.\nWe can do this to get non-linear decision boundaries on the original predictor space, but it‚Äôs usually quite computationally expensive. The way to fix the problem is beyond the scope of this course, but the idea is to use kernel functions. The kernel function typically has a hyperparameter associated with it. Two of the most popular examples:\nThe polynomial kernel, with hyperparameter = the degree of the polynomial. The radial kernel, which has hyperparameter typically denoted ‚Äúgamma‚Äù (a positive number).  Uses nearby training data for classification, where larger values of gamma allow for data to be further.   Note that SVC and Maximum Margin Classification are special cases of SVM.\n Multi-class Prediction If there are more than two classes to predict, we can use one of two approaches to do the classification. Suppose there are \\(K\\) categories.\nApproach 1: One-vs-one, or all-pairs This approach fits an SVM to all pairs of categories. That is:\nSubset the data to only include two of the \\(K\\) categories. Fit SVM Repeat 1-2 for all possible pairs.  Classification is made using the ‚Äúpopular vote‚Äù.\n Approach 2: One-vs-all This approach fits an SVM for each category against ‚Äúother‚Äù. That‚Äôs \\(K\\) SVM‚Äôs in total. That is:\nChoose a category \\(j\\). Lump all other categories into one category called ‚Äúother‚Äù. Fit SVM Repeat 1-2 for all \\(K\\) choices of \\(j\\).  Remember the measure of ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù introduced in 4.3, as the absolute value of the left-hand-side of the equation of the hyperplane? We choose the category that results in the highest confidence score.\n  SVM in python The scikit-learn documentation for running SVM‚Äôs in python is available here.\nIn general, the machine learning paradigm in python (at least with scikit-learn, the go-to machine learning library) is to\nInitialize the method. Fit the model. Query the fit.  You can run classification in python with the sklearn.svm bundle of methods. From this bundle, the method SVC is useful for SVM‚Äôs (despite its name), and LinearSVC is a special case when the classification boundary is linear (what we‚Äôve been calling SVC).\nLoad SVC like so:\nfrom sklearn import svm Let‚Äôs use a dataset from the documentation\nfrom sklearn.datasets import make_classification X, y = make_classification(n_features=4, random_state=0) X is a matrix of the predictors (as a list of lists), with predictors in the columns, and observations in the rows. y is a list of labels/categories, with length equal to the number of rows of X.\nLet‚Äôs use scikit-learn.\nInitialize the model.  We‚Äôll store the initialization in a variable called my_model. We can use the defaul of SVC, like so:\nmy_model = SVC() Or I could have specified hyperparameters here. For example, specify SVC(C=10, kernel=\u0026quot;rbf\u0026quot;) for a penalty of \\(C=10\\), using the radial basis function kernel (you can use the gamma argument to control gamma, too). More details are in the documentation.\nFit the model.  This is typically done in scikit-learn by appending .fit(X, y) to your initialized model, where X and y are as above.\nmy_model.fit(X, y) Recall that, with python, the above code modifies the object my_model.\nQuery the fit  Now we can go ahead and do things with the fit, such as make predictions:\nmy_model.predict(X_new) If X_new is like X (possibly with a different number of rows), then predictions will be made on this new data set. Note that this above code does not modify my_model, like appending .fit does.\nWe can calculate accuracy:\nmy_model.score(X_new, y_new) where y_new is like y, but for X_new.\nWe can also calculate the distance to the decision boundary by appending .decision_function:\nmy_model.decision_function(X)  ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"95d8b807ed53480ca3718eb5d449f0f4","permalink":"/post/svm/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/svm/","section":"post","summary":"Overview  Maximal Margin Classifier, and hyperplanes Support Vector Classifiers (SVC) Support Vector Machines (SVM) Extensions to multiple classes SVM‚Äôs in python Feedback on Assignment 1 Lab: work on Assignment 3   The setup Today, we‚Äôll dicuss a new method for binary classification ‚Äì that is, classification when there are two categories.

What about bouncing files back and forth amongst collaborators through email? Or even keeping track of your own files between multiple devices?\nDo you currently have a way of handling these sometimes frustrating scenarios? Any horror stories?\n[I developed and delivered this mini-lesson as part of instructional skills training at UBC]\nLearning Outcomes Version control is a powerful solution to these regular dilemmas. By the end of this very brief lesson, learners are anticipated to:\n Understand the central concepts and values of version control Identify areas of your own work that can benefit from version control Name the prominent version control software, and one prominent cloud-based hosting service  What is Version Control? Git? Version control is a widely used solution for keeping track of files between devices and collaborators over time. The most prominent software is called \u0026ldquo;git\u0026rdquo;.\nI like to think of git as the next level to saving a file. Just like regular file saving has (hopefully) become a regular part of your workflow, version control requires you to regularly make snapshots of your files. These snapshots are called commits.\nSave like crazy. Commit frequently.\nThough, commits aren\u0026rsquo;t really \u0026ldquo;snapshots\u0026rdquo;. Git doesn\u0026rsquo;t actually store an entire copy of your file each time you commit! Only the changes (or diffs) are stored, so there\u0026rsquo;s no need to sweat any storage demands!\nWhat is GitHub? There are cloud-based services that provide both file storage and a nice interface for git built into them. Perhaps the most prominent of these services is GitHub (others are Bitbucket and GitLab). The added step here is to push changes from your computer up to GitHub.\nSave like crazy. Commit frequently. Push before you\u0026rsquo;re interrupted by a fire.\nHow exactly are my versioning and collaboration problems solved? In many ways!\n Easily identify changes: file changes are highlighted by GitHub. No more detective work to see exactly what was changed in a file. Retrievable history: you can easily reconstruct your files as they were at any point along the commit history.  No more need to keep loads of file versions!  No more uncertainty as to who has the most up-to-date files. They\u0026rsquo;re on GitHub!  Personally, I\u0026rsquo;ve been using GitHub more and more, if only for the peace of mind of having a retrievable history, and a record of how my thoughts progress over time. And maybe it\u0026rsquo;s just me, but I also find that dedicating myself to committing keeps me focussed, because they force me to think about what I\u0026rsquo;m doing (instead of just doing it).\nOther tools Although git and GitHub always work, they work best with plain-text files. If you work with the Office suite of tools like Word, you should first of all consider whether you should really be using this. If you still want to use Office, then perhaps consider options built into the Office tools, or Google docs.\nBack to you What areas of your own life could benefit from version control with Git and GitHub?\nCheck your email inbox for emails with attachments to get a sense of the areas of your life that might benefit from version control.\nNext time you go to transfer a file, be mindful of the cognitive load that comes with the file transfer. You might be better off using a version control system like git and GitHub.\nLearning More If you want to learn more, I recommend starting with a cloud-based service like GitHub. It\u0026rsquo;s a gentle introduction to the subject, and is easier to use than plain git, and has plenty of helpful guides.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"36293394a9877ce46034996cb21a6cab","permalink":"/post/2018-08-14-git_github/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2018-08-14-git_github/","section":"post","summary":"Does this happen to you?

There‚Äôs a package called flexclust that allows for more flexible cluster analysis. The kcca function is particularly useful.\nAt its basic, kcca works similarly to kmeans. In fact, this will run a standard \\(k\\)-means algorithm:\nsuppressMessages(library(flexclust)) (fit4 \u0026lt;- kcca(dat, 3)) ## kcca object of family \u0026#39;kmeans\u0026#39; ## ## call: ## kcca(x = dat, k = 3) ## ## cluster sizes: ## ## 1 2 3 ## 92 59 99 But, the output is less friendly than kmeans (because kcca uses a formal S4 object-oriented format). The multitude of output can be extracted by @ instead of $. For example, here are the cluster assignments, and the final three centers:\nfit4@cluster ## [1] 2 3 3 3 2 3 3 2 1 2 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 3 2 2 2 3 3 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 2 ## [36] 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 3 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 ## [71] 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ## [106] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 1 1 2 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ## [141] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 ## [176] 3 3 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 1 2 3 3 3 3 2 3 3 2 3 3 3 2 3 3 3 3 2 3 3 3 3 3 ## [211] 3 3 3 2 2 3 3 3 3 3 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 ## [246] 3 3 3 3 3 fit4@centers ## x y ## [1,] 2.4487745 -1.1781922 ## [2,] 0.1910489 0.3025144 ## [3,] -1.6003047 -1.5694850 Notice that there is no sum of squares output, like there is in kmeans ‚Äì this is because kcca doesn‚Äôt necessarily use the euclidean distance. However, there is a way to convert a kcca output to a kmeans output, though this output is more limited than usual (the only ss available is $withinss):\nfit4b \u0026lt;- as(fit4, \u0026quot;kmeans\u0026quot;) fit4b$withinss ## [1] 167.92353 96.14623 161.87687  Tweaks The most useful thing about kcca regarding Lab 1 is kcca‚Äôs ability to do \\(k\\)-means++. This can be done through the control argument.\nThe control argument should be a named list, with each name corresponding to some property you‚Äôd like to indicate. See ?cclustControl for the various options. But the one we‚Äôre interested in is ‚Äúinitcent‚Äù, which controls how the initial centers are chosen. From the documentation, this should be:\n Character string, name of function for initial centroids, currently ‚Äúrandomcent‚Äù (the default) and ‚Äúkmeanspp‚Äù are available.\n So to do \\(k\\)-means++, this amounts to:\n(fit5 \u0026lt;- kcca(dat, 3, control=list(initcent=\u0026quot;kmeanspp\u0026quot;))) ## kcca object of family \u0026#39;kmeans\u0026#39; ## ## call: ## kcca(x = dat, k = 3, control = list(initcent = \u0026quot;kmeanspp\u0026quot;)) ## ## cluster sizes: ## ## 1 2 3 ## 95 68 87 Another feature of kcca is that it allows for different distance metrics besides euclidean. This can be indicated through the family argument. Take a look at the kcca documentation under ‚ÄúPredefined Families‚Äù to see what distance metrics you can use.\n  ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"6d68caa4840f5ac4dbe50c373f26c182","permalink":"/post/kmeans_in_r/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/kmeans_in_r/","section":"post","summary":"This tutorial discusses the implementation of \\(k\\)-means (and variants) in R.\nLet‚Äôs use a simulated dataset.

It gets at the posterior by generating samples based on the posterior and statistical model.\nYou‚Äôll need to download and install JAGS.

Model written in R as a function, but using JAGS language; or inputted from file.   Also, the coda package is useful for working with the output of at least runjags.\nAbout the JAGS language:\n Generates samples of parameters based on the prior and statistical model. Need to specify which parameters you want to include in the output (aka ‚Äútrack‚Äù or ‚Äúmonitor‚Äù). Specify probability distributions similarly to R, except:  Draw samples using calls like dexp and dnorm, not rexp and rnorm. The JAGS version of rnorm uses the precision (=1/variance) instead of standard deviation. The documentation of JAGS code is not as nice as R. You have to look things up from a table-of-contents-style search from this document. Page 29 shows the aliases for various distributions.

In 1(b), you saw that there are many loadings matrices that we can take so that the Factor Analysis assumptions are still satisfied (i.e., more than one loadings matrix ‚Äúworks‚Äù). We explored some of the possible loadings matrices by multiplying by a rotation matrix, denoted \\(R\\) in the lab assignment.\nThe varimax rotation is one such rotation that leads to loadings vectors that have a desirable property (in terms of interpretation): it ‚Äúpolarizes‚Äù the loadings vectors so that the values within a vector are either close to zero or are large in magnitude. A nicely ‚Äúpolarized‚Äù loadings vector is useful for interpretation, because features that are relevant to the underlying factor become easier to identify. For example, if the loadings vector for Factor 1 has loadings close to 1 for Features A and B, and close to zero for all other features, then we can look for something common between Features A and B (for example, ‚Äúbitter flavour‚Äù) that describes the factor underlying the data.\nHow can one achieve a loadings matrix whose vectors are polarized as much as possible? We need some concrete measure of ‚Äúpolarity‚Äù to maximize. One trick is to maximize the variance of the squared loadings (squaring the loadings allows us to disregard sign). This is what varimax does.\nThe specific formula can be found on Slide 29 in Lecture 6.\n Your task Write a function in R that takes a value of \\(\\theta\\), and does the following:\nComputes the rotation matrix \\(R\\). Computes the rotated loadings \\(L_R = LR\\). Computes sum of variances of the squared loadings in each column of \\(L_R\\).  This function returns a measure of ‚Äúpolarity‚Äù in your loadings vectors (in terms of the total variance) ‚Äì the larger the total variance, the more polarized your loadings vectors are. As such, you should find the value of \\(\\theta\\) that maximizes this ‚Äúpolarity‚Äù (maximizes this function). Use this \\(\\theta\\) to compute your rotated loadings.\n ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"67f23d6b50db735870d8b242e0ac667f","permalink":"/post/varimax/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/varimax/","section":"post","summary":"What is Varimax? In 1(b), you saw that there are many loadings matrices that we can take so that the Factor Analysis assumptions are still satisfied (i.e., more than one loadings matrix ‚Äúworks‚Äù). We explored some of the possible loadings matrices by multiplying by a rotation matrix, denoted \\(R\\) in the lab assignment.\nThe varimax rotation is one such rotation that leads to loadings vectors that have a desirable property (in terms of interpretation): it ‚Äúpolarizes‚Äù the loadings vectors so that the values within a vector are either close to zero or are large in magnitude.","tags":null,"title":"Varimax Rotation","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" email: vincenzo.coia@gmail.com\nWork Experience 2017/01 - present\nLecturer of Data Science\n(Previously: Postdoctoral Teaching and Learning Fellow)\nMasters of Data Science Program, the University of British Columbia\nVancouver, BC\n2009/05 - 2014/05\nShort-term statistical consulting (6 projects)\nUBC and private\n Education PhD in Statistics\n2012/09 - 2017/02\nThe University of British Columbia\nConferred May 29, 2017\nMSc in Mathematics and Statistics (Statistics)\n2011/09 - 2012/08\nBrock University\nConferred on October 13, 2012\nBSc (3-year) in Biological Sciences\nMinor in Earth Sciences\n2005/09 - 2011/04\nBrock University\nConferred ‚ÄúWith Distinction‚Äù on October 22, 2011\nBSc (Honours) Mathematics Integrated with Computers and Applications\nConcentration in Statistics\n2005/09 - 2011/04\nBrock University\nConferred ‚ÄúWith First-Class Standing‚Äù on June 7, 2011\nVolunteer Positions 2016/09 - 2016/02\nScience World at TELUS World of Science \nVancouver, BC\n78.15 hours\n2013/10 - 2014/05\nBeaty Biodiversity Museum: Events Volunteer\nVancouver, BC\n35.0 hours\n2013/04 - 2013/09\nUBC Farm\nVancouver, BC\n102.5 hours\n2011/06 - 2011/08\nProject S.H.A.R.E. community garden\nNiagara Falls, ON\n15.0 hours\n Research Assistantships 2013/05 - 2013/08\nRobust penalized regression\nSupervisor: Dr.¬†Gabriela Cohen-Freue\nDepartment of Statistics\nThe University of British Columbia\nVancouver, BC\n2012/05 - 2012/08\n2011/05 - 2011/08\n2010/05 - 2010/08\nExtreme value modelling\nSupervisor: Dr.¬†Mei Ling Huang\nDepartment of Mathematics\nBrock University\nSt.¬†Catharines, ON\n2010/09 - 2011/06\nQuantum monte carlo simulations\nSupervisors: Dr.¬†Stuart Rothstein; Dr.¬†Wai Kong (John) Yuen\nDepartment of Chemistry and Department of Mathematics\nBrock University\nSt.¬†Catharines, ON\n Teaching Assistantships Duration: From the latter part of my undergrad, to the end of my PhD.\nUBC:\n SCIE 300: Communicating Science (5x)  Brock University:\n MATH 4P82/5P82: Non-parametric Statistics MATH 3P82: Regression Analysis MATH 4P81/5P81: Sampling Theory MATH 3P81: Experimental Design (2x) MATH 2F40: Mathematics Integrated w/ Computers and Applications II    Publications and Talks Articles Submitted to Refereed Journals  Huang, M.L., Coia, V., and Brill, P.H.
