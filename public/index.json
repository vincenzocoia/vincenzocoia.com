His pro-active approach encompasses:\nencouraging responsible behaviour sustained education managing expectations developing the skills and confidence necessary to live an age-appropriate lifestyle.\nHe approaches youth care with a holistic philosophy, which focuses on keeping youths mentally, physically and emotionally engaged.\nFor children under the Spectrum, Shawn provides 1-to-1 applied behaviour methods that assist children and youth in developing skills, specifically in the areas of: communication, social skills, play, behaviour, cognition, joint attention, imitation, fine motor skills, gross motor skills and personal independence.\nLearning skills at home can be beneficial for the child and can make it easier for them to generalize those skills for various day-to-day tasks. Therapy at home also allows parents to work on therapeutic goals with materials available at home. Beyond the therapeutic benefits, therapy at home provides parents the convenience of having one less appointment to drive their child to and more time to spend with their child.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"70e6661b6b0bb92b05cd900088289d18","permalink":"/authors/shawn/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/shawn/","section":"authors","summary":"Shawn's Philosophy Shawn provides a treatment strategy that focuses on how your child‚Äôs thoughts, beliefs, expectations and attitudes affect their feelings and behaviour.
