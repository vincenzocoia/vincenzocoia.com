The Binomial Distribution
================

\[ \] **Materials**: Paper and pen/pencil.

Pre-quiz
--------

1.  Suppose you have 6-sided and fair dice. What's the probability of rolling:
    1.  A 3 on the roll of a die?
    2.  Snake-eyes? (i.e., two 1's after rolling two dice).
2.  On a given day, there's a 50% chance that your toaster works. What's the probability that...
    1.  your toaster works exactly one day in a given week?
    2.  BONUS: your toaster works at least one day in a given week?

\[ \] Pre-quiz done!

Share your answers
------------------

How did you come up with those numbers?

These can all be calculated using the \_\_Binomial distribution\_!

Anyone familiar?

\[ \] Sharing done!

Learning Objectives
-------------------

By the end of the lesson, when faced with the task of computing a probability, learners are anticipated to be able to:

-   Identify whether the probability can be computed using the binomial distribution.
-   Apply the binomial distribution formula to compute the probability.

\[ \] Objectives done!

1. Can the Binomial distribution be used to compute a probability?
------------------------------------------------------------------

You need two ingredients.

### Ingredient \#1:

*Outcome = number of "wins" of independent "games".*

**Question**: What are the "games" in the pre-quiz questions? What's a "win"?

-   \[ \] I'll do Q1
-   \[ \] Can you do Q2?

\[ \] Ingredient 1 done!

### Ingredient \#2:

*The probability of winning a game stays the same across games.*

\[ \] **Question**: What are the probabilities of winning a game for Q1 and Q2? Are they the same across games?

\[ \] Ingredient 2 done! All ingredients done!

2. How to use the Binomial distribution to compute a probability
----------------------------------------------------------------

Formula for *x* wins out of *n* games. Probability of success *p*:

$$\\frac{n!}{x!(n-x)!}p^x(1-p)^{n-x}$$

**Activity**:

1.  \[ \] Let's work through Q1 together
2.  \[ \] You do Q2 on your own. Write it down!
3.  \[ \] Share/revise answers with peer.
4.  \[ \] Communicate answers

\[ \] Using the formula = done!

Summary
-------

-   Use the binomial distribution to compute probability of number of "wins".
-   A "win" can be *so many things*!
    -   rain (vs. not rain)
    -   getting to work in less than 30 minutes (vs. not)
    -   passing a course (vs. not)
    -   etc...
