[I developed and delivered this mini-lesson as part of instructional skills training at UBC]

Does [this](http://phdcomics.com/comics/archive_print.php?comicid=1531) happen to you? What about bouncing files back and forth amongst collaborators through email? Or even keeping track of your own files between multiple devices?

Do you currently have a way of handling these sometimes frustrating scenarios? Any horror stories?

## Learning Outcomes

__Version control__ is a powerful solution to these regular dilemmas. By the end of this very brief lesson, learners are anticipated to:

- Understand the central concepts and values of version control
- Identify areas of your own work that can benefit from version control
- Name the prominent version control software, and one prominent cloud-based hosting service

## What is Version Control? Git?

Version control is a widely used solution for keeping track of files between devices and collaborators over time. The most prominent software is called "git".

I like to think of git as the next level to saving a file. Just like regular _file saving_ has (hopefully) become a regular part of your workflow, version control requires you to regularly make snapshots of your files. These snapshots are called _commits_.

Save like crazy. Commit frequently. 

Though, commits aren't really "snapshots". Git doesn't actually store an entire copy of your file each time you commit! Only the changes (or _diffs_) are stored, so there's no need to sweat any storage demands!

## What is GitHub?

There are cloud-based services that provide both file storage and a nice interface for git built into them. Perhaps the most prominent of these services is [GitHub](https://github.com) (others are [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) and [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/)). The added step here is to _push_ changes from your computer up to GitHub.

Save like crazy. Commit frequently. Push before you're interrupted by a fire.

## How exactly are my versioning and collaboration problems solved?

In many ways!

- Easily identify changes: file changes are highlighted by GitHub. No more detective work to see exactly what was changed in a file. 
- Retrievable history: you can easily reconstruct your files as they were at any point along the commit history.
    - No more need to keep loads of file versions!
- No more uncertainty as to who has the most up-to-date files. They're on GitHub!

Personally, I've been using GitHub more and more, if only for the peace of mind of having a retrievable history, and a record of how my thoughts progress over time. And maybe it's just me, but I also find that dedicating myself to committing keeps me focussed, because they force me to think about what I'm doing (instead of just doing it).

## Other tools

Although git and GitHub always work, they work best with plain-text files. If you work with the Office suite of tools like Word, you should first of all [consider whether you should really be using this](http://ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu/~cottrell/wp.html). If you still want to use Office, then perhaps consider options built into the Office tools, or Google docs. 

## Back to you

What areas of your own life could benefit from version control with Git and GitHub? 

__Activity__: Check your email inbox for emails with attachments to get a sense of the areas of your life that might benefit from version control. Pick a partner, and share and initiatives that you think could benefit from version control. Share with the class. 

Next time you go to transfer a file, be mindful of the cognitive load that comes with the file transfer. You might be better off using a version control system like git and GitHub.

## Learning More

If you want to learn more, I recommend starting with a cloud-based service like GitHub. It's a gentle introduction to the subject, and is easier to use than plain git, and has plenty of helpful [guides](https://guides.github.com/).
