Improv and Life
================

Who's seen improv shows? Knows lessons?

Learning Objective
------------------

By the end of today's lesson, using two activities based on improv theatre, learners are anticipated to

-   Demonstrate how saying yes to ideas opens up new possibilities in work and life.

Activity \#1: Yes, and...; Yeah, but...
---------------------------------------

**Part 1:**

-   Pair up.
-   Someone starts: "Hey! Let's \[activity\]!!"
-   Go back and forth: "Yes! And, \[...\]".
-   I'll stop you after 1 minute.
-   Rule: you *must* give an *overly* enthusiastic "yes".

**Part 2:**

Same thing, but say "yeah, but..."

-   Rule: appear displeased with the others' suggestion.

**Discussion:**

-   Any take-aways?
-   When is either useful?
-   Which type of person are you?

Activity \#2: Story time
------------------------

Teams: one big team of 5.

Goal: Build a cohesive story in a team, using 5 parts.

Each person gets a component of the story:

-   Setting
-   characters
-   problem
-   stakes
-   solution

**Discussion**:

-   Any take-aways?

Summary
-------

Saying yes in group settings leads to new opportunities!

Use "yeah, but..." to refine ideas.
