## Here's a little tutorial on how to use the `factanal` function for Factor Analysis.

## Let's make a data frame using actual factors:
set.seed(3847)
F1 <- rnorm(100)
F2 <- rnorm(100)
X1 <- F1 + F2 + rnorm(100)/5
X2 <- 4*F1 * rnorm(100)
X3 <- -6*F1 * rnorm(100)/4
X4 <- F2 + rnorm(100)
X5 <- 4*F2 - 0.5*F1 * rnorm(100)
dat <- data.frame(X1=X1, X2=X2, X3=X3, X4=X4, X5=X5)

## Let's do a factor analysis with k=2 factors. There are two main ways you can do this.
k <- 2

## Method 1: via the data.
## Just indicate the data in the first argument, and specify the number of factors
##  in the `factors` argument.
## Note that loadings that are "essentially zero" are indicated as blanks.
factanal(dat, factors=k)

## Method 2: via the covariance matrix.
## Indicate the covariance matrix in the `covmat` argument. 
## Note: this method doesn't have as many features, such as hypothesis testing,
##  built into it. But the results are the same.s
factanal(factors=k, covmat=cov(dat))

## Another important thing to note is how to do *rotations*. There are two
##  built-in rotations available via the `rotations` argument -- they are
##  "none" and "varimax" (default). So the plain factor analysis results
##  without rotation is:
factanal(dat, factors=k, rotation = "none")

## You can extract the loadings vector by extracting the list component
##  entitled `loadings`. There's a weird print call associated with the
##  object, but it's really just a matrix, as the last call indicates.
fit <- factanal(dat, factors=k, rotation = "none")
fit$loadings
fit$loadings[1:5, 1:2]
```
