It's important to me that I promote an inclusive environment both in and outside of
the classroom, both in person and online. I will not tolerate discriminatory behaviour.

To promote an inclusive environment, I like to challenge
myself by asking, "would I respond differently if this person was a different
gender? race? looked a different way?" -- this helps me identify my own implicit
biases. Despite my efforts, if I ever do
discriminate against someone, or make an uncalled for assumption, I welcome
being called out on it, and I sincerely apologize and would like to right the mistake.
