Hello! I'm a statistical data scientist in the applied earth sciences at BGC Engineering Inc. based out of Vancouver; formerly, an Assistant Professor of Teaching at UBC.

Statistically, I specialize in evaluating uncertainty and dependence modelling. That means fitting probabilistic models when many variables are involved, including space and time. I focus on characterizing extremes from these models, to inform risk assessments. Some methods I use include copula models, extreme value theory, and quantile learning.

In the earth sciences, my project work includes flood frequency assessments, climate modelling, and evaluation of aerial imagery for hydrotechnical hazard identification.

I mostly use R to conduct my analyses, but occasionally use python or C++ when needed. I emphasize workflows that are robust and readable on top of being accurate and reproducible -- features I have found are best obtained using domain-specific languages, which abound in the tidyverse. I advocate for domain-specific languages for manipulating and evaluating probability distributions, and have made an R package to this end (distplyr; see below).

My hobbies include outdoor recreation :evergreen_tree: such as hiking :mans_shoe:, birding :bird:, skiing :ski:, fishing :fishing_pole_and_fish:, canoeing :rowboat:, and others. I can also identify birds, and other things about nature.
