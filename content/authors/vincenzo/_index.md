Hi!

I'm a data scientist at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver. My primary focus is the development and delivery of the Master of Data Science program. 

My hobbies include outdoor recreation such as hiking, birding, skiing, fishing, canoeing, and others. 

Preferred personal pronouns: he/him/his

Some of the things I do:

- I solve problems using statistics, machine learning, and data visualizations.
- I interact with students to make data science more approachable.
- I use R, git, and friends to help me do these things. 

I can also identify birds, and other things about nature.
