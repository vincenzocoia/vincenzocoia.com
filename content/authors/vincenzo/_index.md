Hello! I'm an Assistant Professor of Teaching at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver in the Department of Statistics. I lead a research program and a consulting company focusing on evaluating uncertainty, especially in the context of risk. I use modern R packages, including my own, to generate insight. My application area tends to be in hydrology, but I work more generally in the space of environmental applications. 

My hobbies include outdoor recreation :evergreen_tree: such as hiking :mans_shoe:, birding :bird:, skiing :ski:, fishing :fishing_pole_and_fish:, canoeing :rowboat:, and others. I can also identify birds, and other things about nature.

[Here are generic slides I use to introduce myself.](about_me.pdf)
