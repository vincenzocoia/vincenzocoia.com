Hi! 

I'm an Assistant Professor of Teaching at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver. My priority here is to develop data science initiatives through the Department of Statistics.

My hobbies include outdoor recreation :evergreen_tree: such as hiking :mans_shoe:, birding :bird:, skiing :ski:, fishing :fishing_pole_and_fish:, canoeing :rowboat:, and others. 

Some of the things I do:

- I solve problems using statistics, machine learning, and data visualizations.
- I interact with students to make data science more approachable.
- I use R, git, and friends to help me do these things. 

I can also identify birds, and other things about nature.

[Here are generic slides I use to introduce myself.](about_me.pdf)
