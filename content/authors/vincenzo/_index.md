Hi! 

I'm an Assistant Professor of Teaching at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver in the Department of Statistics. I lead a research program focusing on predictive distributions: adapting methods in quantile regression, integrating extreme value modelling, and producing R packages with domain-specific languages. I apply these in consulting, especially in environmental applications such as flood forecasting. 

My hobbies include outdoor recreation :evergreen_tree: such as hiking :mans_shoe:, birding :bird:, skiing :ski:, fishing :fishing_pole_and_fish:, canoeing :rowboat:, and others. I can also identify birds, and other things about nature.

[Here are generic slides I use to introduce myself.](about_me.pdf)
