  Shawn started working with my 4 year-old son 5 years ago, who has ASD. Shawn established a rapport and an engaging relationship with him within a few sessions. Shawn coaches our son in areas that are challenging for him: specifically, social and contextual language skills; adaptability to changes; capability to stay on required agenda; and general developmental abilities.

  Our family (including our son's grandparents), his nanny and his teacher in school have observed significant improvements in various areas within the short 5 months. They were excited to "report" our son's openness and communication initiatives to me. Shawn takes a holistic approach in his work with our son and has become part of our family while maintaining his professionalism. He constantly thinks of ways to help our son and incorporates members of our family, teachers, and therapists in his approach so that our son has a consistently conducive environment in overcoming his challenges. In addition, Shawn exposes our son to everyday life situations with a firm and encouraging attitude so that our son is pushed appropriately to his learning potential with trust in "Shawn's way".

  Our family is very fortunate to have Shawn on board in helping our son's development and we look forward to more positive changes.

  Our son was diagnosed with ASD and (PDD-NOS) at aged 2 and a half years old. Our son began showing more signs of autism and displayed challenging behaviours that were too difficult for us to handle.​​​​​​

We had hired several specialist that have worked with us over a period of 8 months,

However, it is Shawn who has changed our lives. His outstanding skill at dealing with children who have special needs is like nothing I have seen before. He has been able to achieve with our son what no other specialist has. Through constructive play, patience and innovative ideas, Our son has made progress in all areas,  allowing Shawn to teach him different activities and develop the skills to bring him to age appropriate. 

After 2 weeks of working with Shawn, our son ran to the window and waited for Shawn's car to pull up. He then ran to the door, took Shawn's hand and pulled him downstairs to the therapy room without giving me a backward glance. 
  
Shawn truly has a unique way in bringing out the best in children, all children. We have come to rely upon Shawn for helping us with our son in all aspects of day to day living with a child that has autism. His methods and common sense make life so much easier for all of us and we value him as a person as well as a professional in this field.​

Shawn began by assisting our, then 9-year-old son, who was displaying academic and behavioural challenges. Shawn implemented therapy and methods that helped our son progress rapidly during the first month. His teachers, peers and other family members noticed the change almost immediately. Our son's confidence skyrocketed and he was able to absorb new information willingly. His confidence, self-independence, and self-worth strengthened. It took less than a couple of months before our son no longer thought of himself as "the dumb one" amongst his peers. 

Thanks to Shawn's dedication, our son, now 16, is now attending one of the most prestigious schools, where he was one of a few who were selected out of hundreds. This accomplishment was due to his academic success, and his strong confidence to take on any task.​​​​​​​​​

Shawn's extensive background in family relations helped counsel and guide our family through several personal crises. He provided a pro-active approach to problem solving with the family as a whole.

Shawn isn't just our family specialist, he's now a member of our family.
