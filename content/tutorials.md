Over the years, I've written some tutorials/lessons for my students, and have delivered some talks. You might find them useful, so, here they are! I'll be updating this page now and then. 



Talks:

- 2019-03-16: I was invited to the SFU/UBC Joint Seminar to give a talk, called ["The squared error has friends, too!"](tutorials/20190316-ubc-sfu.html).
