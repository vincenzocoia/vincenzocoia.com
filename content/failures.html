<p><strong>Under Construction</strong></p>
<p>Why this document? It’s important to recognize a failure when it happens, as a first step towards learning from the failure. That’s what this page is. In addition, I haven’t always done this – there have been times that I’ve been hesitant to call some failures a failure. I’m hoping this page will help me avoid sugar-coating failures in the future so that I can <a href="https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/lead-to-win-with/080-how-to-fail-better-0UneBxMHsal/">“fail better”</a>.</p>
<p>This is definitely not an exhaustive list/discussion. In addition to sugar-coating failures, I’m relying on memory.</p>
<p>I’ve made this page public so that I can hopefully inspire others to take ownership over their failures too, but also to show everyone that I’m human, too. I got the idea from <a href="https://www.mikegelbart.com/">Mike Gelbart</a>, but the idea seems to have originally stemmed from <a href="https://www.nature.com/naturejobs/science/articles/10.1038/nj7322-467a">Melanie Stefan’s <em>Nature</em> article</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>No published papers from my PhD</li>
<li>I never ended up submitting my first two R packages, <a href=""><code>copsupp</code></a> and <a href=""><code>cnqr</code></a>, to CRAN, because they are a mess and are incomplete.
<ul>
<li>I’m turning this around: I’m nearly finished a new-and-improved paper and analysis, and have new framework for new R packages (see <a href="">distplyr</a> and <a href="">coperate</a>).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Applied to several positions coming out of my PhD to no avail: including Boeing and Amazon.</li>
<li>Scholarships: I failed to get many, but two notable ones that I was not successful for was the Vanier and CGS-D scholarships (although I did get PGS-D).</li>
<li>I dropped an oenology and viticulture course in my undergrad because I couldn’t handle the workload of six courses, and I failed the midterm exam.</li>
<li>I struggled to get A’s in my biology courses in undergrad.</li>
<li>I signed up for a half marathon and didn’t run it because I failed to adequately prepare.</li>
<li>Several rejections for submissions to peer reviewed journals.</li>
<li>I’ve never won any formal individual fencing competitions in my ~6 years of fencing.</li>
<li>I once joined a kettlebell gym ($100+), and failed to go even once.</li>
</ul>
